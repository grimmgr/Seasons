# Seasons

A weather dashboard for Justin Bieber fans.  

Users can lookup the weather in cities around the world, and the background picture of Justin will change based on the current conditions of the city they searched.  As well as current conditions, users can scroll through a five day forecast.  When using devices with screen sizes of 700px or larger users can see a list of past cities they've searched, which they can click to search that city once again.
